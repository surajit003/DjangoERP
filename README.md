# DjangoERP

A complete set of ERP tools built with Django Rest Framework and Vue js

Structural Architecture of the Project
- Everything resides in the core directory
- The apps are named by the following convention `core/apps/crm`, `core/apps/common`, `core/apps/hrm`, `core/apps/fintech` etc
- The frontend code resides in core/frontend and it is separated by app name e.g `frontend/crm`, `frontend/hrm/` etc

High Level Overview of the Backend architecture and the Why?
- I have decided not to go with the ideal MVT architecture of Django.

- Taking inspiration from DDD, I have structured the project into the following :

        domain - where all the domain logic goes.

        repo - where all the repository logic goes.

        logic - where all the busines logic goes.

        handlers - where the usual views and webhooks go.

        tests - where the tests go. However, the tests are further broken down by domain/ , repo/, logic/ , handlers/

- All the Django apps will follow the above structure. This design has been chosen also to separate Infrastructure concerns coupling the code.

- Since, I am designing the architecture with complete freedom, I am going with Pydantic for data validation, serialization and de-serialization instead
of the inbuilt DRF serializers.

        - Inspiration was taken from this thread - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24161828

## How processing occurs ?

On a high level, let's understand the different layers of processing

        - User request is routed through the url patterns and hits the right view.

        - The correct view function based on the request.method gets the data.

        - The data is then handed over to a logic function which is typically the business logic layer.

        - The logic then interacts with the repository method and invokes the right repo method.

        - Repository interacts with the database and saves or gets the data.

        - The data is then returned to the view

Small gotcha ?

        - The view uses something called factories to generate the right repository for ops. What the heck is a use_case_type ?
        Well, put it this way - Think about, if you decide to save the data to an external crm e.g hubspot.
        Then, simply changing the use_case_type="hubspot" is enough and based on the use_case_type_factory will return the right repository.
        So, technically nothing changes in the view and you can plug external crms to save data or get data easily.

        - Additionally, the repository abstracts away all the CRUD logic. So, plugging things in and out
        without worrying about the Infrastructure is a charm.
